  description: "AVMS & Associates is a professional chartered accountancy firm based in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, with more than thirty years of experience across audit, taxation, compliance, and financial advisory services.",
  approach: "Our approach is straightforward: do the work properly, document it thoroughly, communicate findings clearly, and stand behind what we certify. We do not issue qualified audit reports to please a client, and we do not look the other way when something does not reconcile.",
  specialization: "We are not a generalist practice trying to do everything. We have depth in specific areas — statutory audit for scheduled commercial banks, government and public sector audit, forensic investigations, GST compliance and litigation, income tax advisory, and corporate compliance under the Companies Act, 2013."

    bio: "CA Archit Saxena focuses on internal audits, statutory audits, and project evaluations - assignments that require both technical audit discipline and a genuine understanding of how real organizations work. He brings a risk-based approach to every engagement: before designing the audit scope, he spends time understanding the client's specific risk landscape. That way, audit work is concentrated where the real exposures are, rather than spread thinly across everything.\n\nHis experience covers both government assignments and private sector work. Government audit assignments operate under a distinct framework - General Financial Rules (GFR), CAG audit standards, public procurement guidelines (CVC and CPPP requirements), and scheme-specific monitoring frameworks. Private sector assignments focus more on commercial risk, profitability drivers, internal controls over financial reporting, and operational efficiency.\n\nCA Archit's strength in deviation analysis - finding where actual outcomes differ from plans, targets, or budgets - makes his audit reports genuinely useful for management, not just for compliance. The best internal audit report is one that management reads, discusses, and acts on. That is the standard he aims for.",
