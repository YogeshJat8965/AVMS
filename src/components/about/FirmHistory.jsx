                AVMS & Associates was founded in Bhopal in 1993 — the same year India was still absorbing the early effects of economic liberalization. In the three decades since, the country's tax laws, corporate regulations, and banking frameworks have been rewritten multiple times. GST replaced an entire ecosystem of indirect taxes. The Companies Act, 2013 replaced a legislation that had been in place since 1956. The Income Tax Act, 1961 has been amended virtually every year. SEBI tightened disclosure requirements. RBI deepened its audit requirements for banks.

                The firm was built around a straightforward belief: that the role of a Chartered Accountant is not to process paperwork but to genuinely help organizations understand their financial position, meet their legal obligations, and make better decisions. That belief still drives every engagement we take on.

                AVMS & Associates started as a statutory audit practice in Bhopal, primarily serving local businesses and beginning to build its banking audit credentials. As the firm grew, it expanded into forensic audit — brought on by the increasing complexity of financial fraud in the Indian banking sector — and into IT system audits, as core banking technology became central to how banks operate.
